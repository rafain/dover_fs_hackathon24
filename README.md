Dover Fueling Systems Hackathon 2024 Repo

For this Hackathon we decided to build a client specific product recommendation system that shows products from the convenience store in the Anthom screen.
The system works as a web app that reads user transactions based on a specific user id and shows tailored products. This project also manages the scenario when we don't have past data from a customer and still shows relevant products for the client

### File Description
- DoverFueling_Anvil_Marketing.yaml: contains the Anvil application (https://anvil.works/) downloadable file to replicate and upload this to anvil. This is auto-generated by Anvil, but contains the code and page design.
- MarketBasquetAnalysis_AnvilMarketingRecomendations.ipynb: jupyter notebook with logic to generate calculations to select what products to present to the user. Class definition for Recommender that has methods to generate recommendations, this is an API basic definition to get the products.
- datasets.zip: zip file with 2 csv files that have the transactions and the products we used to mock for this project. These files represent the structure we used to present and manage information.
- dfs_anvil_mkt.py: Anvil python code, in a readable way. These presents the logic for the navigation and how we are showing each of the information on the website
